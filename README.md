# Age Adaptive Language Competition in Social Networks

Of the 6,511 languages spoken across the world, over 1500 languages will be lost
by the end of this century, with the rate nearing one language lost per month. 
Better models to predict language loss and change are needed.
We propose a network-based model to model competition between languages,
which depends on an individual’s interactions with other languages, and on the
individual’s ability to learn a new language, based on their age.
